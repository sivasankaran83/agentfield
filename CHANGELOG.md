## [0.1.10] - 2025-12-02


### Added

- Feat: add delete-namespace endpoint for RAG reindexing

Adds a new DELETE /api/v1/memory/vector/namespace endpoint that allows
clearing all vectors with a given namespace prefix. This enables the
documentation chatbot to wipe and reindex its RAG data when docs change.

Changes:
- Add DeleteVectorsByPrefix to StorageProvider interface
- Implement DeleteByPrefix for SQLite and Postgres vector stores
- Add DeleteNamespaceVectorsHandler endpoint
- Add clear_namespace skill to documentation chatbot
- Update MemoryStorage interface with new method

- Feat(sdk-python): expose execution context via app.ctx property

Add a `ctx` property to the Agent class that provides direct access to
the current execution context during reasoner/skill execution. This
enables a more ergonomic API:

Before:
  from agentfield.execution_context import get_current_context
  ctx = get_current_context()
  workflow_id = ctx.workflow_id

After:
  workflow_id = app.ctx.workflow_id

The property returns None when accessed outside of an active execution
(e.g., at module level or after a request completes), matching the
behavior of app.memory. This prevents accidental use of stale or
placeholder context data.

Also fixes integration test fixtures to support the current monorepo
structure where control-plane lives at repo root instead of
apps/platform/agentfield.

### Other

- Ts sdk (ce3b965)

- Recover agent state on restart and speed up node status (7fa12ca)

- Remove unused configuration variables

Audit of agentfield.yaml revealed many config options that were defined
but never actually read or used by the codebase. This creates confusion
for users who set these values expecting them to have an effect.

Removed from YAML config:
- agentfield: mode, max_concurrent_requests, request_timeout,
  circuit_breaker_threshold (none were wired to any implementation)
- execution_queue: worker_count, request_timeout, lease_duration,
  max_attempts, failure_backoff, max_failure_backoff, poll_interval,
  result_preview_bytes, queue_soft_limit, waiter_map_limit
- ui: backend_url
- storage.local: cache_size, retention_days, auto_vacuum
- storage: config field
- agents section entirely (discovery/scaling never implemented)

Removed from Go structs:
- AgentsConfig, DiscoveryConfig, ScalingConfig
- CoreFeatures, EnterpriseFeatures
- DataDirectoriesConfig
- Unused fields from AgentFieldConfig, ExecutionQueueConfig,
  LocalStorageConfig, StorageConfig, UIConfig

The remaining config options are all actively used:
- agentfield.port, execution_cleanup.*, execution_queue webhook settings
- ui.enabled/mode/dev_port
- api.cors.*
- storage.mode/local.database_path/local.kv_store_path/vector.*
- features.did.* (all DID/VC settings)

- Adds more links to documentation

Adds several new links to the README.md file that direct users to more detailed documentation pages. These links cover production-ready features, comparisons with agent frameworks, the full feature set, and the core architecture. (d5a9922)

- Update documentation links

Updates several external links within the README to point to the correct documentation paths.

This ensures that users can navigate to the relevant guides and information seamlessly. (ac6f777)

- Updated arch (4ed9806)

- Improve README Quick Start guide

Updates the README's quick start section to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly guide.

This revision clarifies the installation process, introduces a dedicated step for agent creation with a default configuration option using `af init --defaults`, and specifies the necessary command-line instructions for each terminal in the control plane + agent node architecture.

It also refines the example API call to use a more descriptive agent endpoint (`my-agent.demo_echo`) and adds examples for Go and TypeScript, as well as detailing how to use interactive mode for agent initialization. (4e897f0)

- Refactor README for clarity and expanded content

Updates the README to provide a more detailed explanation of AgentField's purpose and features.

Key changes include:
- Enhanced "What is AgentField?" section to emphasize its role as backend infrastructure for autonomous AI.
- Improved "Quick Start" section with clearer steps and usage examples.
- Expanded "Build Agents in Any Language" section to showcase Python, Go, TypeScript, and REST API examples.
- Introduced new sections like "The Production Gap" and "Identity & Trust" to highlight AgentField's unique value proposition.
- Refined "Who is this for?" and "Is AgentField for you?" sections for better audience targeting.
- Updated navigation links and visual elements for improved readability and user experience. (f05cd95)

- Typescript schema based formatting improvements (fcda991)

- Typescript release and init (218326b)

- Functional tests (99b6f9e)

- Add TS SDK CI and functional TS agent coverage (857191d)

- Add MCP integration (5bc36d7)

- Separate example freom sdk (909dc8c)

- Memory & Discovery (84ff093)

- TS SDK simulation flow working (5cab496)

- Update README.md (4e0b2e6)

- Fix MemoryEventClient init for sync contexts (1d246ec)

- Fix memory event client concurrency and compatibility (2d28571)

- Improve LLM prompt formatting and citations

Refactors the system and user prompts for the documentation chatbot to improve clarity and LLM performance. This includes:

- Restructuring and clarifying the prompt instructions for citations, providing explicit guidance on how to use and format them.
- Enhancing the citation key map format to be more descriptive and user-friendly for the LLM.
- Explicitly stating that the `citations` array in the response should be left empty by the LLM, as it will be injected by the system.
- Updating the `Citation` schema to correctly reflect that the `key` should not include brackets.
- Adding a specific "REFINEMENT MODE" instruction to the refined prompt to guide the LLM's behavior in a second retrieval attempt.
- Minor cleanup and adjustments to prompt text for better readability. (56246ad)

- Update dependencies for improved compatibility

Updates several npm package dependencies, including browserslist, caniuse-lite, and electron-to-chromium, to their latest versions.
This ensures better compatibility and incorporates recent improvements and bug fixes from these packages. (c72278c)

- Implement automatic agent method delegation

Improves the AgentRouter by implementing __getattr__ to automatically delegate any unknown attribute or method access to the attached agent. This eliminates the need for explicit delegation methods for agent functionalities like `ai()`, `call()`, `memory`, `note()`, and `discover()`.

This change simplifies the AgentRouter's interface and makes it more transparently proxy agent methods. Added tests to verify the automatic delegation for various agent methods and property access, as well as error handling when no agent is attached. (26c9288)

- Fix Python 3.8 CI: Disable coverage for Python 3.8

The PyO3 modules in pydantic-core can only be initialized once per
interpreter on Python 3.8. pytest-cov causes module reimports during
coverage collection, triggering this limitation.

Solution:
- Keep --import-mode=importlib for better import handling
- Disable coverage collection (--no-cov) only for Python 3.8 in CI
- Coverage still collected for Python 3.9-3.12

This is a known compatibility issue with PyO3 + Python 3.8 + pytest-cov.

- Fix Python 3.8 CI: Add --import-mode=importlib to pytest config

Resolves PyO3 ImportError on Python 3.8 by configuring pytest to use
importlib import mode. This prevents PyO3 modules (pydantic-core) from
being initialized multiple times, which causes failures on Python 3.8.

## [0.1.8] - 2025-11-23


### Other

- Refactors agent AI token counting and trimming

Replaces lambda functions for `token_counter` and `trim_messages` with explicit function definitions in `AgentAI` to improve clarity and maintainability.

Additionally, this commit removes an unused import in `test_discovery_api.py` and cleans up some print statements and a redundant context manager wrapper in `test_go_sdk_cli.py` and `test_hello_world.py` respectively. (7880ff3)

- Remove unused Generator import

Removes the `Generator` type hint from the imports in `conftest.py`, as it is no longer being used. This is a minor cleanup to reduce unnecessary imports. (7270ce8)
