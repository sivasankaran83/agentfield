## What is Haxen?

Haxen is **infrastructure for autonomous software**. Think of what Kubernetes did for containers, but for AI agents. Plus built-in identity and trust.

> **Haxen isn't a framework you extend with infrastructure. It IS the infrastructure.**

### The Problem

Agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.) are great for **prototypes**. But when you need production systems:

- ❌ **Monolithic deployments** - one team's change forces everyone to redeploy
- ❌ **No native APIs** - your React app can't call agents without custom wrappers
- ❌ **Manual orchestration** - you build your own queues, state management, and coordination
- ❌ **No observability** - good luck debugging multi-agent workflows
- ❌ **DIY infrastructure** - you're building webhooks, SSE, async execution, health checks from scratch
- ❌ **No identity or audit** - logs aren't proofs, compliance teams need cryptographic verification

**Frameworks build agents. Haxen runs them at scale, with trust.**

### The Solution

```
Traditional Frameworks = Flask (single app)
Haxen = Kubernetes + Auth0 for AI (distributed infrastructure + identity)
```

Haxen provides a **control plane** that treats AI agents as **production microservices**:

- ✅ **Deploy independently** - teams ship agents without coordination
- ✅ **REST API by default** - every agent function is instantly an endpoint
- ✅ **Auto-orchestration** - agents call each other, workflows track automatically
- ✅ **Real-time streaming** - SSE/WebSocket updates for frontends
- ✅ **Async execution** - durable queues with webhooks (HMAC-signed)
- ✅ **Built-in observability** - workflow DAGs, execution traces, agent notes, Prometheus metrics
- ✅ **Cryptographic identity** - DIDs for agents, VCs for audit trails
- ✅ **Production infrastructure** - health checks, Docker/K8s ready, horizontal scaling

## ⚡ See It In Action (30 seconds)

### The Scenario
You're building a customer support system with AI. You need 3 agents that coordinate:
- **Sentiment analyzer** - understands customer mood
- **Knowledge base** - finds solutions
- **Escalation handler** - creates urgent tickets

### Without Haxen: 3 Months of Infrastructure

You build: message queues, API wrappers, state management (Redis), webhook system, observability stack, health checks, deployment configs...

**Then** you write agent logic.

### With Haxen: Write 3 Functions, Deploy

```python
from haxen_sdk import Agent

# Agent 1: Support orchestrator
support = Agent("support-agent")

@support.reasoner()
async def handle_ticket(ticket: dict) -> dict:
    # Call agent 2 (different service, different team)
    sentiment = await support.call("sentiment-agent.analyze",
                                    text=ticket["message"])

    # Call agent 3 (knowledge base)
    solutions = await support.call("kb-agent.search",
                                    query=ticket["issue"])

    # Conditional logic - escalate if urgent
    if sentiment["urgency"] == "high":
        await support.call("escalation-agent.create_case", ticket=ticket)

    return {"solutions": solutions, "sentiment": sentiment}
```

**Deploy:**
```bash
haxen dev           # Start control plane
haxen run           # Deploy your agent
```

**You get automatically:**
- ✅ REST API: `POST /execute/support-agent.handle_ticket`
- ✅ Async execution: `POST /execute/async/...` with webhooks (HMAC-signed)
- ✅ Real-time streaming (SSE): Your frontend gets live updates
- ✅ Workflow DAG: Visual graph showing which agent called which
- ✅ Shared memory: All 3 agents access the same state automatically
- ✅ Observability: Prometheus metrics, execution traces, agent notes
- ✅ Identity: Cryptographic proof of every decision (DIDs + VCs)
- ✅ Health checks, Docker/K8s ready, horizontal scaling

**From your React app:**
```javascript
// Call agents via REST API (no custom SDK needed)
const response = await fetch('http://haxen:8080/api/v1/execute/support-agent.handle_ticket', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ input: { ticket: {...} } })
});

// Stream real-time updates
const eventSource = new EventSource(
  `http://haxen:8080/api/v1/workflows/runs/${runId}/events/stream`
);
eventSource.onmessage = (e) => {
  console.log('Agent update:', JSON.parse(e.data));
};
```

**🎨 UI SCREENSHOT #1 (HERO): Add here**
> **What to show:** Workflow DAG visualization from the Haxen UI showing the 3 agents (support-agent → sentiment-agent, support-agent → kb-agent, support-agent → escalation-agent) with execution times, status indicators (green checkmarks), and the visual graph. This is the "wow" moment that shows developers the automatic observability.
>
> **Recommended dimensions:** 1200x700px, annotate with arrows pointing to: "Auto-generated DAG", "Execution times", "Agent-to-agent calls"

**Scale individual agents:**
```bash
kubectl scale deployment sentiment-agent --replicas=10
# Other agents unaffected
```

### That's the difference.

Haxen **is** the infrastructure you'd otherwise spend 3 months building.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Deploy AI Agents Like Kubernetes Deploys Containers

Haxen uses a **two-layer design**: a stateless **control plane** (like K8s control plane) and independent **agent nodes** (like pods):

### Think Kubernetes, But for AI

| Kubernetes             | Haxen                 | What It Means                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Pods**               | **Agent Nodes**       | Your AI agent runs in a container              |
| **Services**           | **Agent Registry**    | Control plane discovers agents automatically   |
| **kubectl apply**      | **haxen run**         | Deploy your agent independently                |
| **Horizontal scaling** | **Scale agent nodes** | Add more replicas per agent                    |
| **Service mesh**       | **Control plane**     | Automatic routing, observability, state        |
| **Ingress**            | **API Gateway**       | Every agent function is a REST endpoint        |
| **Language-agnostic**  | **REST/gRPC API**     | Use Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript, any language |

### How It Works

1. **Write agents in any language** - Python SDK, Go SDK, or raw REST/gRPC
2. **Deploy as containers** - `docker build` + `haxen run` or `kubectl apply`
3. **Control plane orchestrates** - routing, state, workflows, identity, observability
4. **Agents scale independently** - each team owns their nodes, deploys on their schedule
5. **Everything auto-coordinates** - agents call each other via control plane, memory syncs, workflows track

**Key Insight:** Each agent is a **microservice**. Teams deploy independently. The control plane makes them coordinate like a single system.

**Language Flexibility:** Use our Python/Go SDKs for convenience, or implement the REST/gRPC protocol directly in any language. The control plane is language-agnostic by design.

## ✨ What You Get Out of the Box

### 🎯 Microservices Patterns for AI

| Feature                    | What It Does                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service Discovery**      | Agents register on startup. Control plane routes calls automatically. |
| **API Gateway**            | Every agent function = REST endpoint (OpenAPI spec generated)         |
| **Independent Deployment** | Teams deploy agents separately. Zero coordination.                    |
| **Horizontal Scaling**     | Scale individual agents. Control plane load balances.                 |
| **Health Checks**          | Built-in `/health/live` and `/health/ready` for K8s                   |
| **Language-Agnostic**      | Python SDK, Go SDK, or raw REST/gRPC                                  |

### ⚡ Top 3 Features Developers Love

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Real-Time Streaming (SSE) - Keep Frontends Updated</strong></summary>

```javascript
// React: Live updates as multi-agent workflow executes
const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/v1/workflows/runs/${runId}/events/stream`);
eventSource.addEventListener('workflow_run_event', (e) => {
  const event = JSON.parse(e.data);

  if (event.event_type === 'execution_started') {
    setStatus(`Processing: ${event.payload.target}`);
  } else if (event.event_type === 'workflow_completed') {
    setStatus('Complete!');
  }
});
```

**What you get:**
- Real-time workflow updates (execution started, completed, failed)
- Agent notes streaming (AI reasoning visible in real-time)
- Memory change events (see when agents update shared state)
- System-wide execution monitoring

**🎨 UI SCREENSHOT #2: Add here**
> **What to show:** Haxen UI showing a live streaming view of a workflow execution. Display the real-time event stream with timestamps, event types, and a progress indicator. Show the UI updating as events come in.
>
> **Caption:** "Real-time SSE streaming - your frontend stays in sync with multi-agent workflows"

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Async Execution + Webhooks - Don't Block on AI</strong></summary>

**The Problem:** Your AI task takes 10 minutes. You can't block the HTTP request.

**The Solution:**

```bash
# Queue task, return immediately (202 Accepted)
curl -X POST http://haxen:8080/api/v1/execute/async/research-agent.deep_analysis \
  -d '{
    "input": {"topic": "autonomous software market"},
    "webhook": {
      "url": "https://your-app.com/haxen/callback",
      "secret": "your-webhook-secret"
    }
  }'

# Response (instant):
{
  "execution_id": "exec_abc123",
  "status": "queued",
  "webhook_registered": true
}
```

**10 minutes later**, Haxen POSTs the result to your webhook with **HMAC-SHA256 signature**:

```json
{
  "event": "execution.completed",
  "execution_id": "exec_abc123",
  "result": {
    "market_size": "$2.3B",
    "growth_rate": "47% YoY",
    "report_url": "https://storage.example.com/report.pdf"
  },
  "duration_ms": 605000
}
```

**What's handled automatically:**
- Durable queues (PostgreSQL `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`)
- Exponential backoff retries
- Webhook delivery with up to 6 retry attempts
- Fair scheduling (prevents queue monopolization)
- Backpressure controls

[See webhook verification examples →](https://haxen.ai/docs/webhooks)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Identity & Cryptographic Audit - Pass Compliance</strong></summary>

**The Problem:** Your AI agent approved a $500K loan. Two months later, regulators ask:

> "Prove this specific agent made this decision with these exact inputs. Prove it wasn't tampered with."

**Logs can be edited. Screenshots can be faked. You need cryptographic proof.**

**Haxen's Solution:**

Every agent gets a **DID (Decentralized Identifier)**. Every execution can generate a **Verifiable Credential (VC)** - a cryptographically signed proof.

```python
# Enable per agent (opt-in)
if app.vc_generator:
    app.vc_generator.set_enabled(True)

@app.reasoner()
async def approve_loan(application: dict) -> Decision:
    decision = await app.ai("Evaluate loan risk", ...)
    # VC generated automatically with DID signature + input/output hashes
    return decision
```

**For auditors/compliance:**

```bash
# Export cryptographic proof chain
curl http://haxen:8080/api/v1/did/workflow/wf_abc123/vc-chain > audit.json

# Verify offline (no access to your systems needed)
haxen verify audit.json
# ✓ All signatures valid
# ✓ No tampering detected
# ✓ Complete provenance chain
```

**What this means:**

✅ **Pass compliance audits** - export tamper-proof VC chains for regulators
✅ **Debug with certainty** - know exactly which agent version made which decision
✅ **Non-repudiation** - agents can't deny their actions (cryptographically impossible)
✅ **Enterprise sales** - "built-in audit trails" closes deals with regulated industries

**🎨 UI SCREENSHOT #3: Add here**
> **What to show:** Haxen UI showing the DID/VC verification interface. Display a workflow with DIDs for each agent, the VC chain visualization, and the verification status (green checkmarks showing "All signatures valid").
>
> **Caption:** "Cryptographic identity and verifiable credentials - tamper-proof audit trails built in"

## 🎯 When Do You Need Haxen?

### You're Hitting These Pain Points:

- ❌ Your monolithic agent app can't scale - one agent needs 10x capacity but you have to scale everything
- ❌ Your React/mobile app needs custom wrappers to call each agent
- ❌ You're manually coordinating between agents with message queues
- ❌ Debugging multi-agent flows means grep'ing logs from 5 different services
- ❌ You built webhooks, retries, and queue management... again
- ❌ Compliance is asking "prove this AI made this decision" and you have logs that could be edited

### Haxen Solves This

| You Need                                | Traditional Frameworks  | Haxen                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Chatbot prototype**                   | ✅ Quick start           | ✅ Quick start + production infrastructure    |
| **Learning agent concepts**             | ✅ Simple                | ✅ Simple + real-world patterns               |
| **Single app, one team**                | ✅ Lightweight           | ✅ Lightweight setup, enterprise-ready output |
|                                         |                         |                                              |
| **Production multi-agent system**       | ❌ DIY infrastructure    | ✅ Built-in                                   |
| **Multiple teams, independent deploys** | ❌ Coordination hell     | ✅ Deploy independently                       |
| **Scale agents like microservices**     | ❌ Manual                | ✅ Kubernetes-style                           |
| **Compliance/audit trails**             | ❌ Build yourself        | ✅ Cryptographic proofs                       |
| **Frontend integration (React/mobile)** | ❌ Custom wrappers       | ✅ REST API                                   |
| **Long-running tasks (5+ min)**         | ❌ DIY queues + webhooks | ✅ Built-in async + webhooks                  |

**Same code. Same patterns. Zero migration.**

Traditional frameworks force you to rebuild when you scale. Haxen grows with you.

### The Bottom Line

**Frameworks = Build agents** (perfect for learning)

**Haxen = Run agents at any scale** (perfect from prototype to production)

Start with Haxen. Skip the migration pain.
